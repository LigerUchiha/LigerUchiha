About Me
I am a seasoned cybersecurity professional with extensive experience in exploiting vulnerabilities across a wide array of systems, specializing in advanced kernel exploitation, web security, and mobile device hacking. I combine deep knowledge of low-level programming, reverse engineering, and offensive security with cutting-edge research into modern exploit techniques and persistent attack vectors.

My focus is on discovering, developing, and leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities to gain access to high-value targets while maintaining full stealth and persistence. I operate in the realm of advanced exploitation, specializing in tools that outsmart EDRs, AVs, and security mechanisms with a blend of custom malware, shellcode injection, and evasive maneuvers. Additionally, I have deep expertise in satellite system exploitation and black-hat hacking strategies, targeting global infrastructure with sophisticated techniques.

Key Expertise

Kernel Exploitation: In-depth knowledge of Windows and Linux kernel exploitation techniques including RCE (Remote Code Execution), privilege escalation, and bypassing memory protections (DEP, ASLR).

Exploit Development: Specializing in userland exploits, signed vulnerable driver exploits, syscall stubs, and reflective loader techniques.

Web Security: Advanced skills in identifying and exploiting complex web application vulnerabilities including SQL injection, SSRF, RCE, and XSS.

Mobile Hacking: Advanced exploitation techniques for iOS and Android devices, including 0-click exploits, jailbreaking, and bypassing mobile security protocols.

Satellite Hacking: Expertise in exploiting satellite communication systems, including signal interception, satellite jamming, and vulnerabilities in satellite ground stations, with the ability to spoof or hijack signals and gain unauthorized access to satellite networks.

Advanced OSINT: Creating custom OSINT tools for reverse phone/email lookups, tracking, and other reconnaissance techniques.

Zero-Day Exploitation: Researching and weaponizing 0-day vulnerabilities across various platforms with custom-crafted payloads and evasion tactics.

Malware Development: Developing highly sophisticated polymorphic malware, rootkits, and implants with anti-forensics and self-defense mechanisms.

EDR/AV Evasion: Mastery of bypassing endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, antivirus software, and other intrusion prevention mechanisms.

Black Hat Hacking: Engaging in advanced techniques often associated with black hat hacking, including network infrastructure penetration, exploitation of critical vulnerabilities in industrial control systems (ICS), and other high-value targets, while maintaining full operational security and anonymity.

Projects & Contributions

Hypervisor Exploit Kit (HVEK): Developed a full-fledged exploit kit targeting hypervisors with advanced persistence techniques, including BIOS/UEFI-level persistence and watchdog techniques.

GSM Cracking Toolkit: Building an all-in-one GSM cracking solution, featuring SDR sniffing, SIM card brute-forcing, A5/1 cracking, geolocation spoofing, and OSINT modules for deep mobile network exploitation.

Satellite Hacking Tools: Designed a suite of tools to exploit satellite communication protocols and vulnerabilities in satellite systems, enabling signal spoofing, communication hijacking, and data interception.

Red Team Tools: Iâ€™ve created a suite of red team tools for OSINT collection, exploit development, network penetration testing, and post-exploitation with stealth and persistence mechanisms.

Custom Exploit Chains: Focused on full-chain exploits for Windows platforms, including bypassing kernel protections and unhooking techniques to evade EDR and antivirus detection.

Reverse Engineering: Extensive experience disassembling and analyzing malware, vulnerabilities, and software to develop proof-of-concept exploits or to improve detection evasion techniques.

Research Interests

Zero-Day Discovery: Continuously researching for undiscovered vulnerabilities across operating systems, applications, and hardware platforms.

Exploitation Techniques: Innovating and refining techniques such as reflective DLL injection, stack and heap overflow exploitation, and hardware-level attacks.

Red Team Methodologies: Focusing on developing new and improved attack strategies, leveraging social engineering, custom malware, and strategic data extraction to defeat even the most well-defended targets.

Satellite Security: Investigating vulnerabilities in satellite communication systems and developing new methodologies to exploit them for both reconnaissance and attack purposes.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): Researching and developing methodologies for long-term infiltration of target systems, maintaining persistence even under heavy scrutiny.

Notable Achievements

Developed and published various zero-day exploits affecting both Windows and Linux kernels.

Built multiple exploit frameworks that are used by both red teams and external research communities for educational and offensive security purposes.

Created complex malware tools that bypass modern security mechanisms, including heuristic-based detection and AI-powered analysis tools.

Conducted successful satellite system penetration tests involving real-world scenarios like GPS spoofing and satellite communication interception.

Languages & Tools

Languages: C, C++, Python, Assembly (x86, x64), Bash, JavaScript, Go, PowerShell.

Tools: Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, OllyDbg, IDA Pro, Ghidra, Frida, Immunity Debugger, and custom-written scripts and exploits.
